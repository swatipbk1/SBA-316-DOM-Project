Static Music Clone (includes cloning and fragment part of project)
View static music posts with titles, artists, and album covers

The provided code is creating a simple web page that displays music posts with static data. Let me break down the key components:

HTML (index.html):

The HTML file defines the structure of the web page.
It includes a container (<div id="app"></div>) where the music posts will be displayed.
It contains an HTML <template> element (musicTemplate) that acts as a blueprint for each music post. This template includes placeholders for the song title, artist, and album cover.
CSS (style.css):

The CSS file styles the appearance of the web page.
It centers the content using flexbox, sets a background color, and styles the music posts with borders and padding.
Album covers are styled to be responsive (max-width: 100%) and centered within their containers.
JavaScript (script.js):

The JavaScript file contains a function (createMusicPost) that takes data for a song (title, artist, album cover) and creates a music post using the template.
The script fetches static music data from an array (staticMusicData) and creates music posts using this data.
Each music post is then appended to the <div id="app"></div> container in the HTML.
Static Music Data:

The staticMusicData array contains objects with static information about songs, including titles, artists, and album cover image filenames.
In summary, when you open the index.html file in a web browser, it will display a page with music posts, each featuring a title, artist, and album cover. The content is static, meaning it doesn't change dynamically and is predefined in the JavaScript file. This setup allows you to visualize how your music posts will appear on the page.
