Thank you!

Reflection (Optional)

What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

I think I would have explore the internet resources in early stage for good picutres and song dowload would have saved my time a lot.

Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

Requirement were easy but i think i went too deep into it beacuse I wanted to build a real closealike music website with beautification!
Yes, I have struggled a lot for getting music song played in my myTunes library.I have followed the right approach to get the elements selected from DOM and added a song but irresepctive of multiple attempts ,my song playing feature didnt played well.
I would say more hands on practice of Javascript and more time indeed would probably make things done at faster rate.

What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
I would like to get my myTunes Library function to play all the songs I Love nicely and want to improve more of it layout part(CSS).But not all the songs were available for dowload when I started of!

Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:

Planning ahead.
Accumulate all your resources like icons,font family, pictures, dowloading part of graphics , music, or video in advance.
Implementing all without stressing your soul.
